## About the app
Like other weather apps, this one allows you to check the weekly weather and basic metrics of each day of your current location (displayed automatically when the page loads) or check the weather of almost any country around the world. If you prefer, you can also change the metric unit of the temperature between Celcius or Fahrenheit.
